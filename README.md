##To support happy life of pet fish at home

R.I.P - Gyeyomi (Blue Betta Fish Male, Late October 2016 - 16 July 2017)

Gyeyomi was a first pet fish brought by my first daughter. She got Gyeyomi from biology class of elementry school.

I learned a lot of knowledge to take care of happy life of Gyeyomi.

Unfortunately he passed away to Yong-gung(i.e. Dragon palace, fish version of heaven).

Now new Guppy family started their life in the same tank.

To memorize Gyeyomi and share knowledge, this repository is created.
